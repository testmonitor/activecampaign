:bangbang: **Important Notice**: This package is no longer maintained. Feel free to fork the repository if you wish to continue development. Thank you for your support and understanding.

This package provides a PHP SDK for the ActiveCampaign API (v3).

It is inspired by the code style of [Laravel's Forge SDK](https://github.com/themsaid/forge-sdk).

For more information on the ActiveCampaign API, refer to their [developer documentation](https://developers.activecampaign.com/reference).

## Installation

This package can be installed through Composer:

```sh
$ composer require testmonitor/activecampaign
```

Make sure to use Composer's autoload:

```php
require __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';
```

Start by creating a new instance:

```php
$activeCampaign = new ActiveCampaign(ACTIVE_CAMPAIGN_URL, ACTIVE_CAMPAIGN_KEY);
``` 

Your API key can be found in your account on the Settings page under the "Developer" tab.

## Upgrading

ActiveCampaign has announced that [Organizations will be replaced by Accounts](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008108619-Transitioning-from-the-Organization-field-to-Accounts). 
As of version **4.0**, this package will contain various changes to accommodate to this transition.

For this reason, some breaking changes had to be introduced. When you upgrade from 3.0 to 4.0, make sure
to check any references to organizations (for example, in the **createContact** method) and
replace them.

## Usage

Once instantiated, you can simply call one of the methods provided by the SDK:

```php
$activeCampaign->contacts();
```

This will provide you with a list of available contacts.

To create a contact, you can use the `createContact` method:

```php
$contact = $activeCampaign->createContact(
    'johndoe@example.com',
    'John',
    'Doe',
    '1-541-754-3010'
);
```

When the request was successful, `$contact` will contain a Contact object with the contact details.

To retrieve an existing contact or create it when it is missing:

```php
$contact = $activeCampaign->findOrCreateContact(
    'johndoe@example.com',
    'John',
    'Doe'
);
```

When the request was successful, `$contact` will contain a Contact object with the contact details.

## Tests

The package contains integration tests. You can run them using PHPUnit.

```
$ vendor/bin/phpunit
```
